# URL - SHORTENER

The purpose of my URL Shortener project is to allow users to easily convert long and complex web links — for example, 15 or 20 characters long with numbers, and even longer — into short, shareable, and copyable links.

After entering the URL into the “Enter your URL” field and clicking the Shorten button the system generates a 6-character short code and appends it to the original link end.

Then it moves to the Short-URL section and when the code is clicked the user is redirected to the main or related target site.

Each time a short link is clicked the click count automatically increases by +1, the bar chart updates, and the user is redirected to the original website.

Additionally, all links are displayed in the analytics table in real time allowing the user to easily copy them or open them in a new tab, new window, or incognito window.
